# Spotify Version History
Dump of all previous versions of Spotify I could find. (Note: Windows versions only.)<br>
Versions that have dates are not the exact date, the dates are just the earliest occurrences of the specific version I've found online.<br>
0.8.* versions and below are all heavily broken, while 0.9.* versions and above work although some features like Discover in 0.9 will be broken.
There may be missing versions in this list.

## What is the use?
It can be used to find downloads to specific spotify versions through Spotify's own servers and not through a site that could possibly give you malware.
Since this is hosted on Spotify's own servers, it's uncertain if these versions will be wiped in the future.
