# Spotify Version History
Dump of all previous versions of Spotify I could find. (Note: Windows versions only.) 
Versions that have dates are not the exact date, the dates are just the earliest occurrences of the specific version I've found online.
It appears that 0.8.* versions and below are all heavily broken, while 0.9.* versions and above work (mostly) although some features like Discover in 0.9 will be broken. No idea on how to fix it. Also, a lot of versions may be missing from this list, I didn't get all of them.

# What is the use?
Useful repository for downgrading Spotify versions, or just as a version history instead of downloading from dodgy sites.
